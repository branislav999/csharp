# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to strengthen my programming skills in various languages. Through this project, I seek to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts in C# which will hopefully make me more interested in building more using this language.

The software consists of a command-line interface where the user can choose from various options, like add a task, see the upcoming tasks, see all tasks and write/ load the tasks to/ from file. 

The purpose in creating this software is to master the basic programming concepts by implementing real-world functionality in C#. And also, I intend to enhance my understanding of classes and principles in this language. Through this project, I strive to build confidence in my abilities to apply fundamentals of programming.
